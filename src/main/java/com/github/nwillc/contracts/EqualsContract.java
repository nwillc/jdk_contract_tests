 * <li>That hashCodes are also consistent as above.</li>
 * <li>That null is safely viewed as not equals</li>

 * often considers the instance's classes, hashcode rarely does. So while a subclass with the same values may
 * fail to be "equal" it may still have the same hashcode. This contract therefore only compares hashcodes of the same class.</P>
